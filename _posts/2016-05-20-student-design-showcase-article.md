The BCSH team made it into another [article](https://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/co/2016/05/mco2016050098.pdf). The article is about the 'Brain Controlled Smart Home' team, and the project we did for Senior design. 

# The Project
Now that my time working on the project is done, I may as well talk more about it. Over the course of a year, the BCSH team was able to make quite a bit of progress towards our goal of a fully functioning smart home controlled by thoughts. We fully expected this to be a multi year project, so I am quite happy with the progress that we made. (You can check out our [website](http://projects-web.engr.colostate.edu/ece-sr-design/AY15/smart/).)

## Progress
* Fully functioning Virtual Reality Home
  * The lights and doors are all controllable by the user
  * Runs on the Oculus Rift DK2
  * Ported to Samsung Gear VR
* Using the Emotiv EPOC+ headset we were able to correctly interpret users cognitive commands and interract with:
  * A real smart light, and a real smart power strip
  * The devices in our VR home
