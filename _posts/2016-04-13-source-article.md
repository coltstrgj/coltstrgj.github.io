Well Mom, Dad, random german who found my blog by happenstance, I am finally famous. Maybe not like Robert Downey Jr. famous, but my name is in an [article](http://source.colostate.edu/brainy-students-use-brain-waves-control-lights-open-doors/). The article is about the 'Brain Controlled Smart Home' team, and the progress that we have made so far.
