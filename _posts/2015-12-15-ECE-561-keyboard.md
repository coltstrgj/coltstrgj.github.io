# Scratch Build
I have been interested in a mechanical keyboard for quite a while, but finding my favorite has been hard. Everyones tastes are different, so instead of buying another 'one size fits all' keyboard, I decided to build my own perfect model.

## Progress
This project is far from finished, but so far I have: 

1. A fully custom layout including a [CNC'ed aluminum mounting plate](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BytM8VwdGDEvUnBMZ1VLeHprVGM, )
 * Ortholinear keys (the keys are not staggered) for comfort
 * Minimal layout to take up less desk space
1. A hand wired [matrix](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BytM8VwdGDEvNFR2SVJlcXg3ejA)
 * Not as good as a custom PCB, but that will come next when I decide on a final layout and finish the backlighting code
1. Modified [TMK Firmware](https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard) so that the keyboard actually identifies as an HID

## Plans
I have a working design for individual backlighting, but the code is for arduino, so I am working on porting it to teensy, and adding it to the TMK firmware. 

When all is said and done I hope to have a perfect layout for my comfort, individually backlit keys, travelable/stylish case, and the admiration of keyboard enthusiasts everywhere. The keyboard design will be completely open sourced when it is finished (the firmware is now with GPL, but you should check out TMK for a base instead)

# Conclusion
